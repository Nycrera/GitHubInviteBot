# GitHubInviteBot
An API for adding people to a certain github organization.
Warning! Do not use this for public use enviroment. As this tool is not intended for such use.
And this can lead to unwanted results.(Mostly because this app could also be used for spamming the github with your API key.)
Maybe we can secure this later and then we can talk this matter again ;)
But for now this project has no plans of supporting this. Because I just don't have time for it. Or interest.
Just fork it and do whatever you wanna do with it. MIT Licensed.

npm install
node index.js
